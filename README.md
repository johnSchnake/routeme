*NOTE*
This was just a fun sample app for a friend and is no longer maintained. Nor does the apcera-platform link work. Nor does the Apcera company exist any longer. Long live k8s.

Optimize a user's route to a series of waypoints utilizing the Google Maps API.
Up to 8 waypoints supported.

Rather than use the directions API to generate my own map and directions, I just
redirect to leverage Google's own mapping page based on it's optimization of the
route.

Just replace the API key with your own if you would like to use it own
your own page.  API key currently in code is a browser key only enabled for my
own URLs.
